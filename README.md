This program will ask the user to input a string.
An example input would be "Hello" or "Hello World".
The program will take the string input and run it through the reverse string function where it will give you your reversed string.
For example "olleH" or "dlroW olleH".
The function takes the string and turns it into a character array and then runs it through a for loop to reverse the order of the array for as long as the array is.
The function then returns the reversed string to main and main displays the final result.
